_What is unittest in python?_

It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework. This module provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests.

Integration testing is the process of testing the interface between two software units or modules. Its focus is on determining the correctness of the interface.The purpose of integration testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. Once all the modules have been unit tested, integration testing is performed
